**Lehigh Enrollment** This is an infographic based on the Fall 2021 enrollment data at Lehigh University.
Here is my [project](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFM98UGgnM/ExkPVbcchPCNqgtawUqFwg/view?utm_content=DAFM98UGgnM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu) 
Here is the link to the [Fall 2021 enrollment data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf) that I used for my infographic

The information from LaunchMetrics is about the datatsets from Fashion Weeks around the world and how they affected the Media Impact Value. The MIV is essentially an algorithm used to determine if certain marketing decisions were successful. This set can be found [here](https://www.launchmetrics.com/resources/whitepapers/fashion-week-data-report-2020).
Here is my [infographic](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFNEVV9FOk/wEq0sGOZjf_sj58mVSyeug/watch?utm_content=DAFNEVV9FOk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) with the information on it. 
Fashion Week is one of the most iconic events and brings a lot of attention fron the media. To be able to see which brands get the most money from viewers is important to their marketing for future events. A key idea from the data is that influencers and social media have the greatest impact over the media. Essentially, people see something they like and will either invest or induldge in whatever they see in the media. In this case, it is the coverage on Fashion Week and runways. The data will allow researchers to see what needs to change or continue to allow major fashion companies like Chanel, Versace, Louis Vuitton and other high-end brand names. This information is also very important because of the gap from Covid-19. There was definitley a shift in the data where Covid was prevalent and it is very clear to see that the pandemic had an effect on the type of media coverage and the MIV in certain parts of the world.
